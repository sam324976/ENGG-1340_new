## Problem statment
In this project, I am going to build up a small system of information management. The aims of this system is to provide some basic functions for employer to collect and manage the information of employee.

### Function 1: Creating record for new employee
This function is used to create record for new employee and save their information on a file. Thus, the program can extract the data from the file and process them to fulfill the aims of information management. There are few types of data which will be inputted by user, such as employee's name, id , age , salary, role and attribute.

### Function 2: Searching
This function is used to search a specific employee. User can use specific type of data (name/id/role) to find specific employee. 

### Function 3: Fire
This function is used to delete the record from specifc employee. User can use data (name/id/role) to find out the position of the record and remove them.

### Function 4: Edit
This function is used to edit the information from the employee. All types of data except employee's name can be modified. But first, the user must know the name of the employee. It is suggested that they can find name using searching if they dont know.

A menu will be created to list out all the function and allow users to choose which to use. 

## Problem setting
In this project, we are assuming that users will following the instruction provided in the program. If the user does not follow the rule, they will be back to the main menu page and asked to choose and type the information again. Users can use a specfic function multiple times without heading back to the mmain menu page if they want. It will be convenient for hem to make beteer information management.When a error occurs, users need to press a button to continues, it allows user know what is wrong of the input value.
